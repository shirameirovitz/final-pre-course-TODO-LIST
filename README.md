 ## Pre Course Project - Todo List üìã

This project is my final Pre Course Project.
This repository includes a Todo List Web Application which was built with CSS, JAVA-SCRIPT, HTML and automated tests.
 
THE TODO LIST is a single webpage containing different list items and a text area to add custom tasks. 

## The Web offers you to-

  - Add a task by clicking "+". 
  - Mark tasks as done by clicking on the checkbox.
  - Delete a task by clicking on the trash.
  - sort the tasks by clicking on the "sort" button.
  - count the tasks that are stored in the app.
  - Open it in your phone and work with it from everywhere.
  - **automatically save your todos (information), even if you refresh the page or close it.**
  - **make your todo list persist across devices and browsers.**


## Bonus -that I added to the Web:

  - **JSONbin.io**-
    I used JSONbin.io to store JSON data for my web app persistent. I created the data via API by the API  REFERENCE V3 (BETA).Then, i added to the main.js HTTP request that initiates the actions on the server. the "GET" method used to request data and the "PUT" method replaces an existing bin via the API.

  - query media:
  - **Delete a todo**- 
  - **Search and highlight results**-
   To make it easier for the user to find a specific task I created a "search" button that opens a new input to the page. In that input you can write a word and if that word exists in the list it will popup.
  - **Scrollbar list**-
   to make a better user experience on my TODO website I added a scroller to the to do list. That way you would not need to scroll across all the page to get to your latest tasks.

## Submitting

- Change this file (README.md) and style it to showcase your solution (gifs, explanations, link to the github page, links to resources you used, etc...)
- Submit your solution repo to the [ChallengeMe](http://challengeme.suvelocity.org/) system
- Submit your repo link and github page and video to Google Classroom
- Record a 5-10 min selfie video, describe yourself in a few words (age, location, military background, technological background). Also, talk about the solution you submitted (try to explain how your app works in general and which bonuses you added). Think about this video as an interview.
