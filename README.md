 ## Pre Course Project - Todo List üìã

This project is my final Pre Course Project.
This repository includes a Todo List Web Application which was built with CSS, JAVA-SCRIPT, HTML and automated tests.
 
THE TODO LIST is a single webpage containing different list items and a text area to add custom tasks. 

## The Web offers you to-

  - Add a task by clicking "+". 
  - Mark tasks as done by clicking on the checkbox.
  - Delete a task by clicking on the trash.
  - sort the tasks by clicking on the "sort" button.
  - count the tasks that are stored in the app.
  - Open it in your phone and work with it from everywhere.
  - **automatically save your todos (information), even if you refresh the page or close it.**
  - **make your todo list persist across devices and browsers.**


## Bonus -that I added to the Web:

  - jsonbin.io 
  - query media:
  - Delete a todo
  - Undo action
  - Search and highlight results
  - Loading spinner for network request
  - Scrollbar list- (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21998679/css-how-to-make-scrollable-list).
- For added value, you can add jest/puppeteer test to test any bonus feature you implemented

**Add an explanation in `README.md` for each bonus feature you add and a link to any resoure you used**

## Grading policy

- Code quality and style: indentation, Meaningful and non-disambiguate variable names, Comments documentation

## Submitting

- Change this file (README.md) and style it to showcase your solution (gifs, explanations, link to the github page, links to resources you used, etc...)
- Submit your solution repo to the [ChallengeMe](http://challengeme.suvelocity.org/) system
- Submit your repo link and github page and video to Google Classroom
- Record a 5-10 min selfie video, describe yourself in a few words (age, location, military background, technological background). Also, talk about the solution you submitted (try to explain how your app works in general and which bonuses you added). Think about this video as an interview.

GOOD LUCK!
